				ActorsPass' is an online classroom & networking platform that was created for actors by actors. We know how confusing and difficult navigating this business can be and we want to help actors demystify some of the proccess along your journey. We also know that relationships are the keystone to our business and more often than not it's not "what you know" so much as "who you know."

						When you're an actor there are so many elements that are completely out of your control, right? So why not take charge of the things you CAN control? Like building relationships with industry professionals, sharpening your craft, and boosting your marketing materials!
					</p>
					<p class="left_content">In an ever-increasing digital age, it's critical for actors to have an online presence and competitive online materials. ActorsPass gets your online materials seen by TOP industry professionals and gives you the opportunity to work with & learn from them too!</p>
